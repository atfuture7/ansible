This repository is driven from book Ansible: up and run 
2022 edition 

In Ansibook's example, vagrant is used to create multiple VMs to simulate server clusters. 
Vagrant configuration is Ruby based language. 
Ansible playbook is python based language. 

There are prerequisite such as vagrant or ssh key. Will add in later.
